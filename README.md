# PepperTux (Mod version)
Mod for SuperTux 0.?.? named PepperTux. This is sort of like an "experiment" I guess. Tell me if the license is wrong, I don't know what the proper license would be.

The reason why I say 0.?.? is because I'm not sure what version I will make this a mod for. Currently, I want to make it a mod for 0.6.0, but that could change at any time.
