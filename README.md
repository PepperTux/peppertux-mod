# PepperTux (Mod version)
Mod for SuperTux 0.6.0 named PepperTux. This is sort of like an "experiment" I guess. Please tell me if the license is wrong, I don't know what the proper license would be (maybe CC-BY-SA 4.0?)

Any new tiles added needs the image needs the horizontal size to be 128 or smaller so it's easy to add into the tiles.strf file, unless you add it to tiles.strf yourself. I'm not good at editing tiles.strf, even less good at it now.

I recommend using the SuperTux 0.6.0 in the SuperTux Binaries repository by SuperTux Community. This is so you can easily replace the data folder on Windows (Windows hates it when you try to replace something in the Program Files folder, even if it is just SuperTux assets). Make sure you back up the original data folder first if you want to keep it!

Icy Island is being worked on now.

I intend to replace Tux's ground-pound / butt-jump animation with the old image to make this more 0.5-like, however, the Owl images will likely be replaced with the 0.6.3 images.
